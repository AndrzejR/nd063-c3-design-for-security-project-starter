Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1
Web application's server security group allows all ingress traffic from all hosts:
      SecurityGroupIngress:
      - IpProtocol: -1
        CidrIp: 0.0.0.0/0
This should be limited to only the necessary traffic according to the principle of the least privilege. Opening all increases the potential attack surface. 


# Poor practice 2
The application server should be in a private subnet - it should not have a public IP and should connect to the Internet through a NAT gateway. Again to limit the attack surface.
For accesing the application server a bastion host, VDI, or a VPN should be used.

# 3
Also using key pairs to access the server is not a good practice - PAM with identity federation or Systems Manager could be used instead.

# 4
No SSL is used for HTTP endpoint - data being exchanged with the server can be intercepted. 

# 5
S3 buckets do not have "Block public access" enabled - public access may be granted to objects, even though the application is designed to access the objects through the application server, so there's no need for direct public access. 

# 6
S3 buckets are not encrypted
